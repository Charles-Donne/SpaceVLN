# 初始规划提示词 - 在任务开始时生成第一个子任务
INITIAL_PLANNING_PROMPT = """You are a Vision-Language Navigation planning module. Analyze the environment and design the next navigation subtask.

# Navigation Task
{instruction}

# Visual Observations
You are provided with 4 first-person RGB views and 2 bird's-eye view maps:

**IMAGE 1: Front View (0°)**
**IMAGE 2: Left View (90°)**
**IMAGE 3: Back View (180°)**
**IMAGE 4: Right View (270°)** 
**IMAGE 5: Global Semantic Map** - Top-down view of full explored area (with numbered waypoint markers)
**IMAGE 6: Local Semantic Map** - Top-down view of nearby region (focused on agent)

# Map Interpretation Guide

**Map Orientation**: 
- Top of map = Agent's current Front direction (IMAGE 1)
- Map rotates with agent - front is always up

**Global Map**:
- **White**: Unexplored/unknown areas
- **Black**: Obstacles (walls, furniture, barriers, furniture)
- **Green**: Confirmed floor areas (safe to navigate)
- **Orange line**: Trajectory from subtask start to current position
- **Red circle with arrow**: Current position, arrow points to Front direction
  
**Local Map** (zoomed view around agent, same color legend as Global Map):
- Shows finer details in immediate vicinity for precise navigation
- **Blue semi-circle**: Agent's current field of view (Front direction visibility range)
  - The opening of the semi-circle indicates Front view direction
  - Objects within this blue region are currently visible in IMAGE 1 (Front View)
- Better for planning nearby movements and obstacle avoidance

# Your Task

1. **Analyze environment**: Use 4-directional views + semantic map to identify landmarks and obstacles
2. **Plan subtask**: Break down global task into achievable intermediate waypoints
3. **Provide instructions**: Action sequence starting from Front view using concrete landmarks

**Available Actions**: {action_space}

# Spatial Memory (Waypoint History)
{waypoint_summary}

**Note**: Each waypoint shows ID and location description. Waypoint markers appear as **dark red circles with white numbers** on the Global Map, marking past observation positions.

# Your Task

1. **Verify completion**: Compare current observations with completion_criteria (landmark detection, destination arrival, trajectory/orientation)
2. **Make decision**: 
   - **is_completed = true**: Subtask finished → plan NEXT waypoint
   - **is_completed = false**: Not finished → continue SAME subtask
3. **Plan next step**: If completed, update waypoint_sequence and define new subtask; if not, adjust current subtask

**Available Actions**: {action_space}
